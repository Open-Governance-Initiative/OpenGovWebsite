        <div class="side_img"><img src="./images/story.png"/></div>
        <div>The Open Governance initiative was born out of the events of the EndSars protest, where we witnessed Nigerians stand up to demand for justice irrespective our ethnic or religious beliefs.
            <br> <br>
            We witnessed a new Nigeria, a Nigeria bounded in unity, a Nigeria where it didn't matter whether you were Igbo, Yoruba or Hausa, a Nigeria where the Muslims and Chritains saw eachother as brothers and sisters rather than rivals, a Nigeria that you and I were proud of.
            <br> <br>
            We would forever rememeber 20-10-2020, the day peaceful protesters where being gunned down by men in uniform, while singing tha national anthem and waving the natonal flag, a day some of us now refer to as the BlackTuesday.
            <br> <br>
            We would never forget that day, we would never forget the inncoent souls that gave their lives for the liberation of this country, we would never forget the day we truly gained our independence as a country.
            <br> <br>
            This is how the Open Governance Initiative was born, born not out of pain but in hope that one day Nigeria would become a great country we would like to call home.
